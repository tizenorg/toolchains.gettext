* Mon Jul 12 2010 Yan Li <yan.i.li@intel.com> - 0.18.1.1
- Split package according to upstream PACKAGING advice: gettext is
  split into two packages: gettext-libs and gettext-devel.
  gettext-libs is an LGPLv2+ package that contains libraries and
  runtime needed by i18n programs; gettext-devel is used only for
  development and building -- and shouldn't be needed by end users.
  Package that needs gettext should include gettext-libs in Requires
  and gettext-devel in BuildRequires (gettext is now a meta-package
  that depends on gettext-devel for transition.)
- Updated to latest upstream release
- Patch gettext-0.17-open-args.patch dropped, already in upstream
